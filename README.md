# Project1

## Getting started

**I created the gitLab project: Project01, then I created working-branch from main and invited the professors to review the code.**

**Then I cloned the project on my Desktop, started working on working-branch and then pushed the changes:**

```
git clone https://git.brainster.co/Evis.Shkarpa-3/project01
git pull
git checkout working-branch
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push -u origin working-branch
```
